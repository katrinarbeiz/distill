Currently, I work as a Program Coordinator at the Medical University of South Carolina. I hope to pursue a clinical psychology PhD in order to conduct research on the intersections of culture and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. When I'm not attempting to unlock the mysteries of RStudio, you can find me brewing tea, reading psychological thriller novels, or journaling.
